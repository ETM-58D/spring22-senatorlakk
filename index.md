In this kernel I will explore everyhting related to time series forecasting using R. I will be updating this kernel as time goes by because I want to learn as much as possible how the time series lib?aries work using R and to know all its component. This project will be extensive but really useful fr the community to learn about all the different parametersthat compose the time series forecasting. I hope you enjoy this journey no one said it was going ?o be easy but the hard work will reward both the community and myself. Wait for further updates!</p>

<p>This is a comprehensive Ex?loratory Data Analysis for the Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment challenge.I will be using ggplot2 and the tidyverse tools to study and visualise the structures in the data. We have been challenged to automatically classify genetic mutatio?s that contribute to cancer tumor growth (so-called "drivers") in the presence of mutations that are don't affect the tumors ("passengers").</p>

<p>In today's busy world, finding and dating a romantic partner seems more time consuming than ever. As a result, many people have turned to speed dating as a solution that allows one to meet and interact?with a large number of potential partners in a short amount of time. In this report, we want to explore what people are looking for in their speed dating matches, what it takes to become successful in getting approvals from a potential partner, if there ex?st any gender differences, and if any other factors (such as the order you met your partner) influence peoples' decisions. Finally, we'd like to determine if people really know what they want by comparing their self-reported answers to what actually influe?ces peoples' decisions.</p>

<p>This is my first kernel on text mining. I wanted to mine 'real' social media data, an? chose the dataset that contains all Tweets in which Hillary Clinton and/or Donald Trump were involved during the 2016 US presidential election campaigns. After a brief overall data exploration , I quickly moved on to mining the Tweet texts themselve.</p>
